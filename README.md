## Hey 
- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukeWale
- 👀 I’m interested in making things happen... I've done all the static sites, I've done the modifications to others systems, I've done the custom wordpress plugins... now I'm excited for building my own things.
- 💞️ After working for multiple employers for long periods of time I'd love to be able to have my own portfolio of things I've enjoyed doing... If you can't see things here it is likely I have them set to private repos, don't worry!
- 🌱 My current focus is Laravel and front end frameworks such as Vue and React... tipping towards React because it's in demand and its a nice step towards React Native, however Vue was something introduced to me as a natural step due to Laravel. Watch this space!

- 📫 How to reach me ... come and find me!
